# Coding Interview Prep

This repository contains my solutions to coding interview problems in **Python, Java, and C++**.  

## Structure
- Organized **by language first**, then by topic (arrays, linked lists, stacks/queues, recursion, trees/graphs).
- Each solution includes **time and space complexity analysis** in comments.

## Topics
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion & Dynamic Programming
- Trees & Graphs

## Notes
Extra study notes live in the `notes/` folder:
- `big_o_cheatsheet.md` â†’ common runtime complexities
---
### Goals
- Solve every problem in **3 languages** (Python, Java, C++)
- Write clear explanations and complexity analysis
- Revisit and re-implement problems for mastery
